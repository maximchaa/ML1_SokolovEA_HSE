# Course: Machine Learning 1  
## Sokolov EA, FCS, HSE

*My refreshed machine learning notebooks on the [Sokolov EA (FCS, HSE) course](http://wiki.cs.hse.ru/%D0%9C%D0%B0%D1%88%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B5_%D0%BE%D0%B1%D1%83%D1%87%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5_1/2019_2020) (did during summer 2020)*.

<br>**Theme 1**: pandas and matplotlib
<br>**Theme 2**: linear regression, scikit-learn and exploratory data analysis
<br>**Theme 3**: linear regression with gradient descent with own hands
<br>**Theme 4**: data preprocessing, text data; SVM, categorical features, predictions calibration and feature selection
<br>**Theme 5**: decision trees (+ with own hands)
<br>**Theme 6**: ensembles (random forest, bagging & simple boosting), bias-variance decomposition
<br>**Theme 7**: modern gradient boosting libraries comparison (CatBoost, LightGBM), feature importance, blending
<br>**Theme 8** (there's no homework): clustering methods comparison, principal component analysis
